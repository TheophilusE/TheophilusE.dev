## Who I Am

I’m Theophilus Eriata, an Honours Bachelor of Science in Computer Science student at the University of Calgary. From day one, I’ve been driven by the question: how can software and hardware work in harmony to solve real-world problems? My academic journey has taken me through data structures, operating systems, advanced linear algebra, multivariable calculus, each course sharpening my ability to think critically.

## My Vision

I believe the future lies at the intersection of real-time systems, graphics, and robotics. I strive to build experiences that feel intuitive yet are powered by complex, optimized engines under the hood. Whether I’m writing a kernel-level optimization or leading a workshop on neural nets, my goal is the same: push boundaries, share knowledge, and create technology that empowers others.
