## Introduction

Water Molecular Dynamics Simulation is a physics-driven C++ application that recreates the emergence of water molecules from individual oxygen and hydrogen atoms. By computing bonded and non-bonded forces at each time step, the program delivers a scientifically grounded yet visually engaging demo of molecular behavior in an interactive 3D environment.

## Project Overview

- Purpose: Offer an educational, real-time window into the forces shaping water at the molecular scale.
- Engine Core: Custom C++ simulation engine with ImGui for live parameter tweaking.
- Key Algorithms:
  - Harmonic bond stretching for O–H bonds
  - Harmonic angle bending for H–O–H geometry
  - Lennard-Jones and Coulomb potentials for non-bonded interactions
- Platforms: Windows and Linux.

## Features

- Dynamic molecular interactions governed by physics-based potentials.
- Real-time ImGui interface to adjust:
  - Oxygen and hydrogen atom counts
  - Initial velocity scale
  - Simulation box dimensions
- Performance overlay with FPS, compute timings, and debug console.
- Built-in plotting of water molecule formation progress over time.

## Settings Panel

| Parameter               | Default | Description                                       |
|-------------------------|---------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Oxygen atoms            | 100     | Number of O atoms spawned at simulation start     |
| Hydrogen atoms          | 200     | Number of H atoms spawned at simulation start     |
| Initial velocity scale  | 1.0     | Scales random initial velocities of all atoms     |
| Simulation box size     | 10×10×10| World bounds for atom positions and reflections   |

Use the sliders and numeric inputs in the ImGui panel to experiment with density and kinetic energy on the fly.

## Visualization and Debugging

A debug overlay provides real-time statistics:

- Frame rate display (toggle with F5).
- Kernel timing breakdowns.
- On-screen graphs plotting the count of complete H₂O molecules over time.

Screenshots and performance data help you understand both the molecular dynamics and the engine’s efficiency.

## Controls

- Camera: WASD + mouse to fly around the simulation box.
- UI Toggle Keys:
  - F2: Open/close debug console (Tab for auto-complete).
  - F5: Show/hide FPS counter.
  - F12: Capture a high-resolution screenshot.

These shortcuts let you navigate, inspect, and document the simulation without interrupting the main loop.

## How It Works

At each integration step, forces on every atom are summed from:

1. Bonded Forces
   - Harmonic bond stretching:
     $ V_\text{bond} = \tfrac{1}{2} k_\text{bond} (r - r_0)^2 $
     Keeps O–H bonds near their equilibrium length.
   - Harmonic angle bending:
     $ V_\text{angle} = \tfrac{1}{2} k_\text{angle} (\theta - 104.5^\circ)^2 $
     Enforces the natural H–O–H angle.

2. Non-Bonded Forces
   - Lennard-Jones potential for van der Waals interactions.
   - Coulomb’s law for electrostatic attraction/repulsion.

Positions and velocities update via simple velocity-Verlet integration, ensuring stability at small time steps.

## Future Work

- Refine angle-bending model for more precise H₂O geometry.
- Add explicit thermostat to control temperature.
- Support multiple species (ions, contaminants).
- Expand visualization modes (surface mesh, volumetric density).
