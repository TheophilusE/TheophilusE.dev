## Overview

PoseSense is a real-time human pose and gesture recognition system built with a Python backend and a TypeScript/Vite frontend. The project focuses on accurate pose extraction, quaternion processing, and live visualization of skeletal motion. It serves as a foundation for gesture‑driven interaction, motion analysis, or real‑time character control.

## Features

### Real-Time Pose Estimation
The backend runs a deep learning model to extract human joint rotations in real time. It streams pose data over a lightweight API for immediate use in the frontend.

### Quaternion Processing & Retargeting
PoseSense converts raw joint quaternions into *bone‑local rotations*, enabling consistent retargeting to rigs such as Y‑Bot. This involves quaternion normalization, parent‑child transform reconstruction, and interpolation matching between backend and frontend.

### Web-Based 3D Visualization
The frontend uses TypeScript and a modern build pipeline (Vite) to render a live 3D skeleton, with support for streaming pose updates, rig visualization, and debugging of joint transforms.

## Technical Stack

### Backend
- Python
