## Introduction

This is an anecdote to my semester courcse Math 265 at the University of Calgary. In this post, I share a bit on how my semester went, along with strategies I employed to employed that resulted in a high academic success in the course.

## Mathematical Reflection

> How my mathematical communication skills have been impacted by this course, is it positive or negative? What feedback do I have in general about the course, in relation to mathematical writing.

When reflecting on how my mathematical communication skills has developed throughout the course, I discover that I really had more opportunity to demonstrate critical thinking through written work. I have had exposure to many academic papers, from which I have adopted many modes of writing, but I hadn’t really had much reason to write in such manner, and demonstrate such mannerisms in my written work until this course. The mathematical writing activities made me feel like I was writing proofs, thus making me take it more professionally than it needed to be. I suppose my submitted work could be categorized as quasi-like in nature, when comparing it to proofs written by academic giants. However, I think I made great efforts to ensure that my work reflected more of what was thought in the course, rather than external or overly complicated techniques (even though I wouldn’t mind doing that). This may be unique to my experience, but I felt like it was much better to seek feedback from TA’s at the Math Help Centre as the mathematical maturity of the course mates I sought feedback from, were not beneficial to the effect of making notable improvements other than semantic adjustments. I do not hold hard feelings though, I wouldn’t assume that people can give what they do not have. Overall, the mathematical writing were one of my highlights in this course that I would recommend to be persistent throughout the course’s future.

When examining the written portion of my midterm 2, I think it could be written better than it was. I spent a lot of time trying to solve one question that somehow I did miss an important detail in the prompt that would have saved me the act of spinning wheels and going nowhere. This of course affected my thought process when addressing the written portion during the latter parts of the exam. My written response to the last question was not correct, due to only writing it in thirty seconds and missing a lot of detail. It could be improved by adding proper introduction to what I am trying to solve, and answering questions such as where is the interval? What do we (I and the reader) know about the setting? What does the mean value theorem represent? As well as including a concluding statement as to what I have solved for, and what it represents (even if it is a reiteration). Overall, I still did extremely well… even though my mark did not truly reflect that I am capable of providing proper solutions to the problems given in the exam.

## Main Takeaways

> What are my main takeaways from this course? What learning experiences are meaningful to me? Did I think this course was beneficial to me?

To begin, it is important to note that I am a Computer Science Major in Math 265, as such I have had prior experience to Calculus and its branches (the differential, and the integral) covered in this course. As such, my views expressed in this document are biased and are unique to myself. Compared to my other 4 courses, this course and the way it is ran during my time is excellent as far as learning is concerned, which I would personally rate as **the gold standard**! This is not to say that the course had a lot of hand-holding or spoon-feeding, but it gave a lot of opportunities to fully digest the content being taught and highlighting the key to studying Mathematics, which is **UNDERSTANDING** and **PRACTICE**! Sure, my interest played a major role in understanding the material, but my other courses did not cater to the way I learn, in the manner this course did. One downside in this course, is that the content was not rigorous enough to reflect the history and derivations of the Calculus (which is fine), but I saw people making the mistake of thinking it was “easy” just by memorizing a few steps shown in the notes and not calling to mind what could be understood from said content, and how its applicable to future content. This is of course not to discredit or invalidate anyone’s learning, or how they feel about the course. As aforementioned, my main takeaways are the mathematical writing exercises, of which I was able to demonstrate quasi-proof writing, in addition to the Webworks, which I highly enjoyed, as it felt great to see green check marks after completing each problem set. In addition, I found the D2L quizzes quite helpful and beneficial as they really highlight the important bits of the topics, as well as posing questions which encourage a higher level of thinking to draw conclusions from. One thing I dislike is when I keep hearing “plug in” or “plugged in”, which is not canonical as there is no plugging of anything, where the more formal language is **substitution** or “substitute”. I should add that this informal language as escaped my lips a few times (haha).

To clarify my interpretation of the experience, I think it was the right level of difficulty for an introductory Calculus course, I was able to move with or past the pace of the course from prior experience. The course notes are lacking in rigour, but the exercises make up for it by incurring a higher level of thinking than one-to-one copy from the notes. If you have read this bit thus far, it will interest you to know that I play the role of volunteer TA (with permission, of course) at the Math Help Centre, having over 78 hours of volunteer service. This of course gives new light to how the course notes lacking rigour is actually a strength, as it makes it easier to explain the same thing multiple times with varying levels of understanding without having to delve into the esoteric details. I am well versed in the content, should there be any cause for alarm to this fact, as well as clarifying when needed that wasn’t an **employed** TA, as well as committing no academic misconduct by giving away the solution easily (at most, all parties involved derive the solution together when acceptable). Being able to teach the course content to my peers and other course individuals (Math 275) made it easier for me to remember past knowledge and their applications. I would say the Dino problems were beneficial to some, but for myself they were not overly practiced by me. I instead learnt more about the material from written text instead of attempting the Dino problems that were repetitive in nature (with no reward of a green check mark or percentage grade) and helping with Dino problems at the Math Help Centre. I wouldn’t testify that I never did the Dino problems; if I had more time I most likely would have done all of them, but alas, I seldom attempted them.

## Closing Statement

> What more could I have to write? What are my closing thoughts?

If you read note thus far, thank you for taking the time to acknowledge my honest reflection piece. I want to take this opportunity to thank my God, and the teaching team for making this course the highlight of my semester, I am truly grateful. I ask that this course continues to improve, I knew this course was going to be awesome for me when I was greeted with the introductory videos on *Obtaining A Higher Learning, Thinking About Your Thinking,* and *Embracing Failure* by Dan Wolczuk, those videos were highly beneficial to me in ways I cannot write here. I got to know a lot of amazing people at the Math Help Centre, and I do wish them the best in their positive future endeavours.

Cheers,

Theophilus E.
